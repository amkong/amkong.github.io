      <p>Collingwood School has gifted me with not only a solid education but has provided me with skill sets that I will use for the rest of my life.  The Four Strands at our school (Academics, Arts, Athletics and Service) I hold responsible for shaping me into the very person I am today.  Both the academic and extracurricular opportunities I have enjoyed here have prepared me well to take on challenges that I will face tomorrow. </p>
