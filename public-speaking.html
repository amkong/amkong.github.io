      <h2>Public Speaking</h2>
      <div class='spacing'></div>
      <p>The annual public speaking competition at my school is without doubt the most nerve-racking event of the year; an event that evokes high fear amongst the student body.  I was fortunate to have been able to set my fears aside (and I certainly had them in grade one!) at a young age and accomplish things that I am most proud of to this day.   I am greatly honored to hold Collingwood School’s record for <strong>10 consecutive gold wins</strong> in public speaking – the highest number of gold medals achieved by a student in the school’s history.</p>
      <p>In October last year, I was invited to participate in the International Independent Schools Public Speaking Competition at The York School in Toronto.  I found it to be an amazing learning opportunity for me and I was fortunate to place 2nd in the Newscast Radio Category.
